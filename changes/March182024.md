## Leap

### INTERNALS
- [Adds support for a new fork_database persistent file version (v2), which can store two versions of the fork_database. Needed for consensus transition.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2306)
- [Implementation of finality digest, a hash of a series sub-digests, required for IBC verification.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2282)
- [In some cases use assert instead of FC_ASSERT.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2301)
- [Consider voting immediately on a block if its final on strong qc block reference has been validated.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2290)
- [Add new, v7, snapshot version to support changes from faster finality.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2297)
- [Support replay over instant finality transition by delaying consumption of the fork database until after all blocks are replayed.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2287)
- [Simplify fork db consolidating on `fork_database get_block`](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2284)
- [First step, supporting all replay scenarios. Move `chain_head` from fork database back to controller.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2278)
- [Rules for voting on blocks that are not yet validated. Part of the improved core finality algorithm work.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2275)
- [Incorporate blocks received while producing into fork database. Previously late blocks were dropped.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2274)
### TEST
- [Tune logging inside fork_database to be less verbose now that stricter checks are in place.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2318)
- [Relax constrains on nodeos startup for greater test stability, and avoid simultaneous unlinkable blocks from all connections.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2292)
### CLEANCODE
- [Final updates for v7 snapshot support.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2315)
### CHORE
- [Merged main branch into Savanna working branch.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2319)
- [Merge updates from main into Savanna branch.](https://github.com/antelopeIO/leap/pull/2280)

## CDT
